This is a university project we did based on ordenation methods
We chose three different methods to determine their efficiency and speed
Our methods were: BubbleSort, QuickSort and MergeSort

The usage is the following:
compile and run creation.c to generate three .txt files that are random numbers,
each of them with different ordered taxes so we could test the methods, then
do the same with organization.c, that will get the numbers, order them, calculate
that method's time and then output the ordered numbers at a new .txt file to check
if all of the numbers are indeed ordered
